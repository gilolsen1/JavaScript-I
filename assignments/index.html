<h2>NOTES</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    keys needed to be strings "". did not seem to be the case in codepen.. possibly just consistent?
    see  line 35 for example. "speak"  as key name for function.
  </li>
  <li>
    no ":" needed when doing method shorthand.  key name ==function name, immediately followed by parameters () see 59 multiplyNums
  </li>
</ul>
